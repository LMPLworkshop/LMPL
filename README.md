# The First International Workshop on Language Models and Programming Languages (LMPL 2025)

(In conjunction with SPLASH 2025, Singapore)

The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have had a profound impact on various areas of programming languages, including program analysis, verification, synthesis, and optimization. This workshop aims to explore these intersections, highlighting both opportunities and challenges, and promoting collaboration between the programming languages and machine learning communities.

## Call for Papers

We invite submissions discussing recent advancements at the intersection of language models and programming languages. This workshop will offer researchers the opportunity to exchange ideas and explore emerging research directions. Unlike existing workshops and conferences in the SE community, such as LLM4Code, AIware, and Forge, LMPL focuses more specifically on programming language-related problems, including program analysis, verification, and optimization. It also explores how PL techniques, such as formal methods and PL design principles, contribute to language model applications. The scope of LMPL includes, but is not limited to:

- **LLMs for PL tasks**
   - LLMs for static analysis, such as program verification, bug detection, program optimization
   - LLMs for code generation, such as program transiplation, synthesis, and repair
   - LLMs for program testing, such as fuzzing and domain-specific system testing
   -Other tasks in the fields of programming languages and software engineering

- **PL techniques for LLM applications**
   - PL techniques for prompt engineering
   - PL techniques for agent design
   - PL techniques for model training
   - PL techniques for hallucination mitigation
   - Other aspects where PL techniques can contribute to LLM applications

- **Benchmarks and Empirical Studies**
   - New benchmarks for specific PL tasks and empirical studies of existing LLM-driven PL techniques.
   - Empirical studies of existing benchmarks, such as the works summarizing or criticizing existing benchmarks.
   - Empirical studies of explainable AI in PL tasks, such as proposing and investigating a specific hypothesis.

We welcome the following three formats of submissions:

- **Research paper**: Similar to research papers presented at various conferences, these should include a well-designed methodology and experimental measurements

- **Position paper**: Presenting look-forwarding viewpoints or showcasing ideas that have not been thoroughly evaluated through experiments

- **Talk paper**: Sharing one or more works that have already been published in other venues. There is no restriction on the venues as long as the topics of the works are in the targeted scope.

## Evaluation Criteria

**For Research Papers and Position Papers:** Reviewers will evaluate each contribution for its soundness, significance, novelty, verifiability, and clarity. Submissions should clearly state how they are novel and how they improve upon existing work. We will employ a double-blind review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-blind review process. In particular, the authors’ names must be omitted from the submission and references to their prior work should be in the third person.

**For Talk Papers:** Reviewers will assess whether the topics of the published works align with the scope requirements. The talk papers will undergo a single-blind review process, where authors can include their names and institutional affiliations in their submissions.

## Submission Instructions

We will use HotCRP as the online submission system. All submissions must conform to the ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format. Specifically, each kind of submissions should conform to the following requirements:

- **Research papers**: 8–10 pages (not including references). The accepted research papers will be included in the proceedings. 
- **Position papers**: 2-4 pages (not including references). The authors can choose whether to publish their position papers in the proceedings.
- **Talk papers**: Only one page offering the following two kinds of information: (1) The abstract of the talk; (2) the references of introduced papers. In principle, there is no limit on the number of works to be introduced, but due to time limits for the talk, it is recommended not to exceed 3 papers. 

Submissions can be made via the submission site by the submission deadline. We encourage the authors to upload their paper info early (and can submit the PDF later) to properly enter conflicts for double-blind reviewing. If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to attend the workshop and present the paper in person.

The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available by ACM. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of SPLASH 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

## Other Material

We also prepare a pdf version of the workshop proposal. Please refer to [proposal.pdf](https://github.com/LMPLworkshop/LMPL/blob/main/proposal.pdf)
